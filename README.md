# Project README

## Project Overview

Welcome to this project! You've recently joined a software development company, and your first task is to set up documentation and infrastructure to support the build process for an existing software project. Your responsibilities include implementing a build system and continuous integration (CI) to ensure the repository's stability for incoming interns.

## Assignment Requirements

### Group Tasks

As part of a group, complete the following tasks:

1. **Clone the Template Repository**
   - Start by cloning the project template repository.
   - **Template Repository URL**: [Gray-Scott Simulation](https://www.github.com/scicomp-durham/gray-scott-sim)

2. **Select a Testing Framework**
   - Choose a testing framework for C++.
   - Suggested frameworks:
     - Google Test
     - Acutest
     - Boost

3. **Implement Unit Tests**
   - Develop at least three unit tests, including:
     - Type verification of model parameters.
     - Size comparison of `u` and `v` vectors.
     - Mathematical correctness for initial conditions (e.g., `u=0`, `v=0`).
     - Determinism for a fixed set of parameters.

4. **Add a README**
   - Create a detailed README with local build instructions, including:
     - Prerequisites and dependencies.
     - Step-by-step build process.
     - Example usage and output.

5. **Set Up a Build System**
   - Develop a reliable build system using chosen tools.

6. **Implement Continuous Integration (CI)**
   - Configure CI to automatically run tests and validate the build.

7. **Prepare a Video Presentation**
   - Record a 4-minute video explaining your contributions, focusing on high-level choices and rationale.

## Important Information

- **Peer Evaluation**: Complete the [peer-evaluation form](https://forms.office.com/e/52CPWjaYvj) for each group member.
  
- **Group Collaboration**: All work should be completed collaboratively within a single, private GitHub repository. Contact the lecturer early if group issues arise.

- **Repository Privacy**: Ensure your repository remains private to your group.

Good luck with your project, and ensure thorough documentation and testing to support future interns!
